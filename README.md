### Description
metaUSAT is a data-adaptive statistical approach for testing genetic associations of multiple traits from single/multiple studies using univariate GWAS summary statistics. This multivariate meta-analysis method can appropriately account for overlapping samples (if any) and can potentially test binary and/or continuous traits.
